 <h2> History of Aprendo International School</h2>
 <p> Aprendo International School was founded in 2010 with a mission to provide a world-class education that embraces diversity, fosters innovation, and prepares students to become global citizens. The founders, a group of passionate educators and community leaders, saw the need for a school that would bridge cultures and educational systems, offering an inclusive, high-quality curriculum for students from all backgrounds.
  Starting with a small cohort of 50 students in a rented facility, Apendo has grown steadily and now serves over 1,500 students from more than 40 countries. Over the years, the school has expanded its facilities to include state-of-the-art classrooms, science laboratories, sports complexes, and cultural exchange programs that enrich the educational experience.
  Apendo is renowned for its focus on holistic development, combining academic excellence with leadership skills, social responsibility, and a deep appreciation for global cultures.
